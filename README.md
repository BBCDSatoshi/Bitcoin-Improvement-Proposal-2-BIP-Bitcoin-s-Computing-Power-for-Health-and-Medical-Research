Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 2 (BIP): Allocation of Bitcoin’s Computing Power for Health and Medical Research

Title: Allocation of Bitcoin’s Computing Power for Health and Medical Research
Author: BBCD Satoshi

Status: Draft

Type: Informational BIP

Created: 21 June 2024

Abstract: This proposal suggests donating a small percentage (ranging from 0.01% to 1%) of Bitcoin’s total computing power each month to assist in solving pressing health and medical challenges. The initiative aims to leverage the Bitcoin network’s computational resources to contribute to research efforts such as finding cures for diseases, developing new vaccines, and addressing urgent medical needs during pandemics.

Motivation: Health and medical research often require significant computational power for tasks like simulating biological processes, analyzing large datasets, and developing new treatments. The Bitcoin network, with its extensive computational capabilities, can provide valuable support to these research efforts. By allocating a portion of its hash rate, the Bitcoin community can contribute to global health advancements and demonstrate its commitment to societal well-being.

Specification:

Allocation: A designated percentage (between 0.01% and 1%) of the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network will be donated to medical research initiatives.

Mechanism:

A system will be developed to temporarily redirect a portion of mining power to support computational tasks for health and medical research.
Participation will be voluntary, with miners opting in to contribute their computational resources to the research pool.
Governance:

A decentralized committee or organization will be established to oversee the allocation and ensure the fair and transparent use of computing power.
The community will be consulted to determine the specific criteria and processes for selecting research projects and responding to medical emergencies.
Impact on Mining: The proposal will ensure that the diversion of computing power does not significantly impact the overall security and operation of the Bitcoin network.

Rationale: By donating a fraction of its computing power, the Bitcoin network can play a crucial role in advancing health and medical research. This initiative can improve Bitcoin’s public image, highlighting its potential to contribute positively to society and address critical global challenges.

Backwards Compatibility: This proposal does not affect the Bitcoin protocol itself and is compatible with existing mining operations. Participation is optional, ensuring no adverse impact on miners who choose not to participate.

Implementation:

Development: Create the necessary software and infrastructure to facilitate the redirection of computing power.
Testing: Conduct extensive testing to ensure the system’s security, efficiency, and minimal impact on regular mining activities.
Deployment: Roll out the system in phases, starting with a pilot program involving volunteer miners.
